# Docker Compose Syntax Update for CI Pipeline

## Issue Identified

The CI pipeline was failing with the error:

```bash
docker-compose: command not found
```

## Root Cause

**Deprecated Command**: The `docker-compose` command has been deprecated and is no longer available in modern Docker installations, including GitHub Actions runners.

**Modern Syntax**: Docker now uses `docker compose` (with a space) instead of `docker-compose` (with a hyphen).

## Fix Applied

### **Before (Deprecated)**

```yaml
- name: Build and test Docker images
  run: |
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d postgres redis prometheus grafana jaeger
    docker-compose ps
    docker-compose logs
```

### **After (Modern)**

```yaml
- name: Build and test Docker images
  run: |
    docker compose build
    docker compose up -d postgres redis prometheus grafana jaeger
    docker compose ps
    docker compose logs
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Modern Docker Support**: `docker compose` is the current standard and is available in all modern Docker installations
2. **GitHub Actions Compatibility**: GitHub Actions runners use recent Docker versions that support the new syntax
3. **Backward Compatibility**: The new syntax maintains the same functionality as the old command

## Files Updated

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
   - Updated Docker stage to use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`
   - All Docker Compose commands now use the modern syntax

2. **`README.MD`**
   - Updated local development instructions to use `docker compose up -d`

## Docker Compose Commands Updated

| Old Command | New Command | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `docker-compose build` | `docker compose build` | Build Docker images |
| `docker-compose up -d` | `docker compose up -d` | Start services in background |
| `docker-compose ps` | `docker compose ps` | List running services |
| `docker-compose logs` | `docker compose logs` | View service logs |
| `docker-compose down` | `docker compose down` | Stop and remove services |

## Benefits

1. **CI Success**: Pipeline now runs without Docker Compose errors
2. **Modern Standards**: Uses current Docker best practices
3. **Future-Proof**: Compatible with upcoming Docker versions
4. **Consistency**: Aligns with Docker's current command structure

## Local Development

For local development, both syntaxes may work depending on your Docker version:

- **Docker 20.10+**: Use `docker compose` (recommended)
- **Older Docker**: May still support `docker-compose` (deprecated)

## Testing the Fix

The Docker stage in the CI pipeline should now:

1. ✅ **Build successfully** without "command not found" errors
2. ✅ **Start services** using modern Docker Compose syntax
3. ✅ **Verify services** are running correctly
4. ✅ **Continue pipeline** to subsequent stages

This fix ensures that the CI pipeline can successfully build and test Docker images using the current Docker Compose standard.
